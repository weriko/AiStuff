"The idea is for Libra to be a so-called “stable coin” which would be backed by a basket of global currencies. That would keep its value stable in contrast with the volatility that has been seen in bitcoin. Libra has scaled down some of its ambitions.

Instead, Facebook’s Libra project will reportedly transition to supporting both existing government-backed currencies, like the US dollar and the euro, and the Libra token when it is eventually completed and ready to launch.",1,e
"Despite those measures, the Libra project was met with swift and vocal backlash from across the political spectrum. Regulators were concerned about Facebook’s potential outsize influence on the project, due to the company having conceived of the idea and having a financial interest in its success, and the unforeseen consequences of allowing for-profit companies to begin issuing currencies and injecting themselves into global economics and geopolitics.",0,p

"According to Brainard, the Covid-19 outbreak reinforces the need for immediate and reliable access to funds. “The introduction of Bitcoin and the subsequent emergence of stablecoins with potentially global reach, such as Facebook’s Libra, have raised fundamental questions about legal and regulatory safeguards, financial stability and the role of currency in society.” This idea has “intensified” the demand for CBDCs to “maintain the sovereign currency as the anchor of the nation’s payment systems.
