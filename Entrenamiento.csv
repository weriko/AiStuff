Cryptocurrency transactions in Africa are growing rapidly. On a continent that already embraces mobile money, virtual currency offers advantages for a young, tech-savvy population.;1;e
Monthly cryptocurrency transfers to and from Africa under $10,000 (€8,500) shot up by 55% over the past year, reaching a peak of $316 million in June.;1;e
Crytocurrencies aim to cut out the middlemen, such as credit card companies or banks, making it cheaper to transfer money from one virtual wallet to another. Cryptocurrencies also aren't controlled by any central authority, which theoretically protects them from any interference by governments.;1;e
Cryptocurrency basically takes what money is to many people and uses technology to make it more transparent and less centralized, so that everybody has a seat at the table when it comes to the future of finance;1;e

Mobile cryptocurrency wallet BRD announced today that it now has more than six million users worldwide, thanks to strong growth in India and Latin America. With this momentum, the company expects to reach 10 million users by early 2021.;1;e
While Bitcoin and Ethereum are still the most popular purchases through BRD, in countries with volatile currency fluctuations, like Venezuela, Argentina and India, interest in stablecoins, which are pegged to the U.S. dollar, is growing. The company is also seeing more adoption in Eastern European countries.;1;e
The company’s most recent funding announcement was a $15 million Series B announced in January 2019 for expansion in Asian markets. BRD also offers enterprise blockchain tools called Blockset and says it is currently used to store the equivalent of about $6 billion in cryptocurrencies.;1;e
Back in March this year, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court revoked a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ruling that banned any entity in India from dealing in, or to be involved with cryptocurrency transactions. While this initially sent a wave of optimism throughout industry players around the world, the reality on the ground is that withdrawing the ban merely moves cryptocurrency into a grey area -- with ambiguity that businesses cannot overlook. Now, the latest development is that the government is looking to outright ban cryptocurrency trading in India.;0;p
The Chinese city of Shenzhen will become a testing ground for a new sovereign cryptocurrency with residents issued millions in the digital coin for free.;1;s
Anndy emphasises that governments are open to the technology so far based on his experiences on the ground when dealing with them. He goes on saying that food security, ID management and controlling the flow of money are some of the “hot” topics. Countries like Singapore, Estonia, South Korea are already embarking their journey to solve problems using blockchain technology together with their existing infrastructures.;1;p
Square said it was making the purchase because it believes “bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future,” calling cryptocurrency “an instrument of economic empowerment” that “provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system.” Square has accepted bitcoin as a form of payment since 2014.;1;e
Interestingly, while other companies may have shrunk their operations due to the pandemic or have had to pause the business, CoinSwitch Kuber, a crypto trading platform for India, was launched right in the midst the coronavirus outbreak. The founders say that they saw a spike in growth because traditional markets have been in turmoil due to COVID-19.;1;s
The recent survey by financial services company Jefferies indicates that US users will barely use Facebook's upcoming stablecoin, Libra, due to a lack of trust.;0;S
The path of national organizations - and amalgamated to traditional systems - towards economic modernization has not been easy. This is evidenced by the multiple regulatory obstacles to Facebook's Libra project, which surprised an inexperienced system with a lack of digital infrastructure.;0;P
Libra claimed to have received interest from 1,500 organizations to join the project, but not all met the eligibility requirements. The announcement came after the abandonment of the seventh company.;0;E
From being a rival of bitcoin to becoming an alternative to Paypal linked to the already established currencies. A change to suit the wishes of regulatory bodies, both European and American.;1;P
To appreciate basic insights on how a cryptocurrency can jeopardize economic stability, compare the Libra plan to Bitcoin’s growth as an important cryptocurrency in the past decade. The Libra may become too powerful and economically unpredictable if issued.;0;E
Although Facebook walked back plans for Libra in April 2020 in response to stakeholder pressure, opting instead for Libra to act more like a digital payment than a global monetary alternative, concerns remain about the project’s scope.;0;E
Being a global currency was Libra's big bet, which differentiated it from other currencies and also made it promising compared to other cryptocurrencies due to its own programming language or opaque reserve. This has been fading little by little over the months and as the concerns of governments and economic organizations have arisen.;0;E
The cryptocurrency bitcoin and Libra, backed by Facebook, could play a role in a world where central banks globally begin to issue their own digital currencies, a former senior central banker told CNBC's “Beyond the Valley” podcast.;1;P
Libra, the stablecoin project that Facebook is trying to boost with the collaboration of other large companies, has signs of being titanic and could pose risks to market stability, according to the European Central Bank.;0;P
Stable-rate cryptocurrencies such as pound, known as stablecoins, aim to establish themselves as an alternative to traditional money and extend access to the financial system. In order to become a global payment system, these types of currencies put aside the volatility of other virtual currencies such as bitcoin.;1;E
Although it relies on currencies, the ECB is afraid of the effects of a loss of end-user confidence in the stablecoin.;0;P
The fear of the Libra, the virtual currency that Facebook wants to introduce, and the impact of the Covid-19 have served as catalysts to boost cryptoeurs. The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced this Friday that it is accelerating work on the possible introduction of a digital euro, an electronic form of money that would complement bills and coins.;0;e
"The report identifies a number of scenarios that would require the issuance of a digital euro. Among them, it highlights ""the creation of private means of payment on a global scale that could generate regulatory problems and represent risks for financial stability and consumer protection"". In other words, the ECB sees the digital euro as its weapon to counteract the influence of Libra.";0;e
The great powers of the EU (Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Holland) have signed this Friday a joint declaration in which they demand the strictest possible regulation of the crypto-currencies that will allow them to prohibit those that do not conform to European requirements.;0;p
The initiative is a declaration of war on the project of the American giant Facebook to create its own virtual currency called Libra, with the aim of achieving cheaper and faster transfers. A project that is currently stopped precisely because of the doubts it generates in regulators around the world.;0;p
"""We put forward a very simple principle: the European Central Bank is the only one that should be allowed to issue currency. And this principle cannot be threatened or weakened by any kind of project, including Libra,"" insisted Le Maire.";0;e
Issuers of crypto assets backed by significant assets (so-called 'stable crypto currencies' such as Facebook's Pound) would be subject to more stringent requirements (e.g. in terms of capital, investor rights and supervision).;0;p
Libra published an updated whitepaper containing four major changes, one of which was the new token mechanism. Instead of a stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies, the project now plans to run a system of a stablecoin backed by a multitude of fiat currencies. Therefore, at launch, there could be tokens such as LibraUSD, LibraGBP and LibraEUR among others.;1;e
Nearly two billion people worldwide use Facebook. The expansion of the shopping cart to include central bank currencies makes it possible for anyone to use Calibra as a more traditional payment system. Any user who has Messenger or WhatsApp installed on their mobile device could send funds worldwide at the touch of a button.;1;s
Tagomi, a New York-based cryptomoney brokerage firm, will join the Libra Association, the governing body of the Facebook-led stablecoin. Tagomi will become the 22nd member of the Libra Association. Members of the association are expected to contribute at least $10 million to the Libra Reserve, which holds the assets that support cryptomonics.;1;e
A silver lining to Libra's rocky start may be the response of central banks as they learn to accept digital currencies as the new reality. Since the project was announced, several countries have explored the possibility of minting a digital currency, including Japan, China and England.;1;p
Seven central banks have joined forces with a clear objective: to create a digital currency that raises the reference alternative and thus serves to try to overcome the efforts of the China project and also proposals such as that of Facebook with Libra.;0;p
Along with the entities mentioned are the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Swiss National Bank, but not the People's Bank of China. This country already has a pilot project underway with its official digital cryptocurrency (DC / EP), and with it they want to achieve that the scope of the yuan is the same as that of the dollar.;0;p
"The financial leaders of the seven largest economies in the world (G7) will announce this Tuesday that they oppose the launch of the ""stablecoin"" Libra, launched by Facebook until it is duly regulated, according to their draft declaration.";0;p
The G7 still holds that no global stablecoin project should begin operating until it adequately addresses relevant supervisory, regulatory and legal requirements through proper design and adhering to applicable standards.;0;p
The G-20 Financial Stability Board set 10 recommendations in April for a common, international approach to regulating stablecoins, after social media giant Facebook proposed the launch of Libra.;0;p
In the past three years, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected several applications for a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This frustrates the hopes of many investors who believed that the price of Bitcoin would rise further if an EFT was approved.;0;e
The most recent Bloomberg newsletter on cryptocurrencies predicts that a Bitcoin ETF could see the light of day if the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Joe Biden, is elected as the next president of the United States. The author believes that a change in command can bring regulatory clarity to drive more investment to the world of digital assets.;1;p
In China there are different cryptocurrencies that work with a blockchain system operated by the government, one of them is the iShenzhen. To encourage its use, 10 million yuan is being raffled off and any interested citizen will be able to participate.;1;s
The iShenzhen is a digital currency, not traditional, because it is a system controlled by the government, to avoid fluctuation, and supported by the People's Bank of China, an official financial institution. According to the American portal, other cities have also presented and tested their cryptocurrencies such as Xiongan, Suzhou and Chengdu.;1;p
In relation to the general requirements that the project poses for companies linked to cryptocurrencies, Idoya Arteagabeitia explains that it is a drastic change, because it goes from having no regulation at all to having to comply with many regulations.;0;p
With these comments, Gómez refers to a declaration signed by Spain, France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, in which they support the European Commission's regulatory plan and request strong rules for stablecoins.;0;p
On this, the Spanish lawyer Javier Maestre wrote an article pointing out that so many bureaucratic, financial and technical requirements will discourage innovation and impose strong entry barriers to markets related to crypto assets.;0;p
"""I think the problem that really worries regulators is Libra (Facebook's cryptocurrency project),"" concludes Gómez Toribio. He affirms that behind all this is the fear of the European authorities that a company with billions of users could place a financial product on the European market, in this case a global stablecoin.";0;p
A Chilean entity dedicated to the education and promotion of the use of cryptocurrencies has issued an alert in the country against 20 companies that promote fraud through the use of cryptocurrencies.;0;s
"During his time as director of the UK Financial Conduct Authority, Bailey told Members of Parliament at a Treasury Select Committee hearing that investors should ""be prepared to lose all [their] money"", as the Crypto asset has no intrinsic value.";0;s
Since September, several reports in Indian media outlets have highlighted incidents of unsuspecting customers being allegedly duped of their money by scamsters believed to be operating crypto ponzi schemes.;0;e
Incidents of wealthy businessmen losing their money through fake crypto wallets have come to light. Such platforms target users through emails and SMSes, asking them to deposit their bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies in a “new” crypto exchange to get the opportunity to trade with other users globally.;0;s

"The efficiency, speed and resilience of cryptocurrencies give people financial inclusion and access advantages, said PayPal President and CEO Dan Schulman, who described the eventual shift from physical to digital currencies as ""inevitable.""";1;e
Diginex became the first crypto exchange operator to list on Nasdaq. Although the business is still in its early stages, a look into Diginex’s operations and filings can give us deeper insights into the exchange industry, historically unknown to the public.;1;e
Once in the business of cryptocurrency mining, Diginex sold most of those operations in 2018 and changed its focus to developing a digital asset financial services stack that includes an exchange, custodian, trading system and other complimentary business lines.;1;e
Mobile cryptocurrency wallet BRD announced today that it now has more than six million users worldwide, thanks to strong growth in India and Latin America. With this momentum, the company expects to reach 10 million users by early 2021.;1;e
People have had a lot more time over the last six months to look at their investments and as a result of that, we found that for cryptocurrency in general, but especially for BRD’s business, we’ve been growing dramatically.;1;e
He added that BRD, which has raised $55 million in funding from investors like SBI Crypto Investment and East Ventures, has two main groups of users. The first are millennials who have discretionary income that they invest using apps like Robinhood instead of traditional brokerages. The second group are people who have been more financially impacted by the pandemic and are turning to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to cope with currency fluctuations in their countries or as a more cost-effective alternative to international wire transfers to send money to family members.;1;e
While Bitcoin and Ethereum are still the most popular purchases through BRD, in countries with volatile currency fluctuations, like Venezuela, Argentina and India, interest in stablecoins, which are pegged to the U.S. dollar, is growing. The company is also seeing more adoption in Eastern European countries.;1;e
BRD is a non-custodial wallet and cryptocurrencies are stored on users’ devices, which makes it more accessible to users in countries who need to undergo lengthy registration processes to use custodial wallets. The app also allows people to use Apple Pay or their bank cards to buy cryptocurrency. This ease of use is one of the reasons for its growth;1;e
The daring few involved in cryptocurrency and blockchain in the Balkans say the benefits could be big, if the regulatory framework is put in place.;1;e
Cash may still be king in the Balkans, but growth in online payments – particularly in the era of COVID-19 – is fuelling optimism among those in the region pressing the case for cryptocurrency.;1;e
In the countries of the former Yugoslavia, many remember the hyperinflation of the 1990s and trust in traditional financial institutions is still in short supply, giving cryptocurrency a potential edge.;1;e
The ability of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to be censorship resistant is seen as a great advantage;1;e
Following US banks receiving the regulatory green light to provide custody storage services for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the summer, recent months have seen a US$50mln investment by US payment group Square inc, as it believes that cryptocurrency “provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system”, and a $425mln investment by business intelligence firm Microstrategy Inc;1;e
The new service makes PayPal one of the largest U.S. companies to provide consumers access to cryptocurrencies, which could help bitcoin and rival cryptocurrencies gain wider adoption as viable payment methods.;1;e
The Bank of England describes the volatility of cryptocurrencies (using Bitcoin as an example) as “the Bitcoin rollercoaster”, with huge peaks and troughs unknown in traditional tangible assets such as gold or stocks. This deters all but those looking for the highest returns;0;p
According to data quoted by cryptocurrency news platform Cointelegraph, between 2017 and 2019, Indian investors have lost more than $500 Mn in cryptocurrency scams operated within the country and abroad.;0;s
many members of Congress are more interested to score political points than in doing the work to understand blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Much of the Congressional response to cryptocurrency amounts to knee-jerk reactions against Facebook’s Libra, rather than a holistic view of the new industry;0;p
Cryptocurrency faces implementation obstacles beyond the lack of regulation and inactive obligations. The technology is an emerging one and is still immature in a system where other options are widely scalable and accepted over it;0;s
Countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Bolivia, and Ecuador have prohibited crypto transactions. The state bank has outlawed it and declared cryptocurrency an illegal form of payment with a heavy fine due to violators. And even where it is legal, there are countless logistical issues;0;p
So-called tokenisation allows a designated cryptocurrency asset — similar to bitcoin — to represent a single security, such as a stock, or a basket of securities, like a fund or an ETF. A handful of firms have begun exploring the idea.;1;e
Conversion remains a huge hurdle for Bitcoin vendors. As Bitcoin is not a fiat currency and is only limited to monetary value when converted to a cash equivalent, not many vendors go for its conversions for other cryptocurrency types. They are more willing to look for a payment method that delivers in Dollars or any other local currency. So that any exchange made for goods and products is made on consumer rates;0;e
As governments print infinite amounts of money through bailouts and quantitative easing, inflation will likely send core prices higher. Clearly, the fiat system is imperfect. The crypto media uses the threat of inflation to proclaim the benefits of cryptocurrencies. Against a backdrop of shrinking gross domestic products, economic slowdown, government bailouts and fiscal stimulus, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been touted as an inflation-resistant hedge;1;e
Neo coin price started the year on a positive note, growing up to $17.8 on February 15. Later on it experienced a sharp drop to its YTD low of $3.93 during the mid-March crash and used this level as a new starting point for continuous growth.;1;e
Russian banks will be allowed to open up cryptocurrency exchanges under the supervision of the central bank — and new digital currencies can be issued, but only again, under the control of the central bank. This represents a more liberal attitude than what some had predicted would be a near-total ban on cryptocurrency activity in Russia, and shows a more pragmatic attitude towards cryptocurrencies and their adoption in Russia;1;p
It’s not that merchants don’t accept Bitcoin. A survey of 500 small and mid-sized businesses in the US by Zogby Analytics on behalf of HSB found that 36% accept cryptocurrency. And large organizations, such as Wikipedia, Microsoft and AT&T, accept Bitcoin.;1;e
The news that renowned investor, Paul Tudor Jones, has backed bitcoin—publicly praising the asset for its properties as a store of value has almost certainly helped catalyse BTC’s sudden movement into the US$10,000 zone;1;e
The U.K.’s decision this month to limit retail access to financial derivatives linked to cryptocurrencies caught the eye of legal experts in the U.S. and is fueling debate about whether Washington could follow the move in London, especially if Democrat Joe Biden wins the presidency;0;p
PayPal will finally agree to buy, sell and pay with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The news, of course, is good for both sides. The market capitalization of Bitcoin has increased and the market capitalization of the Paypal company has increased as well. In fact, the two assets are close in the same range.;1;e
Data released by Arcane Research suggests that despite the demand for peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading platforms in the Middle East, regulations and a lack of infrastructure are holding back their adoption.;0;e
Russian public officials will be required to declare all private crypto asset holdings they own as of New Year's Day 2021. The requirements were announced on October 20 by the office of Russia's attorney general, Igor Krasnov, after a meeting with 15 fellow attorneys general representing the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).The new requirements are a consequence of new laws signed by President Vladimir Putin in July, which will classify crypto assets as physical goods from 2021, recognizing virtual currencies for the first time in the country.;1;p
"Bitpanda founder and CEO Eric Demuth notes that bitcoin's recent upward trajectory is nothing more than the most obvious symptom that ""cryptocurrencies have begun to establish themselves as a trusted asset class for the global financial market."" . ""The‘ crypto ’are here to stay,"" he declared in statements to Invertia. Something that, according to corroboration, has resulted in ""a huge influx of institutional capital and a record number of new new retail customers.""";1;e
Bitcoin accelerates towards the all-time highs it marked three years ago. The progress that has been taking place in these two areas in recent months is a clear engine for analysts in the sector in bringing cryptocurrencies closer to the real economy. On the one hand, they are endowed with greater legal certainty and transparency. On the other, they acquire a utility that has been less explored until now and that leads them towards more and more daily use.;1;e
"In the framework of the digital forum entitled ""Panorama for the regulation of crypto assets in Colombia"", the directive of the Banking Association of the Latin American country said that the cryptocurrency sector can strengthen the country's financial system; as long as they are under a regulatory model that allows them to have control over them.";1;e
Around seven in ten users have expressed concern about the loss of investments related to cryptocurrency balances. Additionally, 17.7 percent of those surveyed said they may not get the benefit they expected from this type of investment.;0;s

we are seeing that companies like Tesla want bitcoin on their balance sheet and BNY Mellon, Mastercard and PayPal/Venmo see the customer demand high enough to meet it.;1;e
Aubrey Strobel, Head of Communications of Lolli, the world's leading bitcoin rewards company, pointed out: “Bitcoin is becoming fully integrated. Now that Tesla has added bitcoin to its balance sheet, retail investors have exposure to bitcoin when they buy $TSLA or the S&P 500.”;1;e

“If you look at active addresses that are used on Ethereum, those are approaching all-time highs, and if you look at the number of addresses with at least 10,000 ETH in them, what I would consider very wealthy addresses, those continue to go up, which is a signal of institutional adoption,” says Bonello.;1;e

Bitcoin is already in Dorsey's portfolio. His other company, Square, bought 4,709 bitcoins in October 2020, equal to $50 million at the time. In 2018, the company expanded its mobile payment service Cash App to support bitcoin trading, even for users without a bank account.

Major cryptocurrency exchanges experienced technical issues on Monday as trading volumes soared after billionaire Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc revealed it had purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment.;0;e
The electric-vehicle company’s move marked the latest step toward mainstream acceptance of bitcoin, sending it 10% higher on expectations that other companies will soon join asset manager BlackRock Inc and payments companies Square and PayPal in backing the cryptocurrency.;1;e
Part of what’s different about bitcoin’s rally in 2020 versus its last run higher, in 2017, is that institutional investors are now adopting bitcoin, lending it newfound legitimacy and helping to erase the reputational risk of investing in the cryptocurrency.;1;e
There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, because, like other cryptocurrencies, it was built around the principle of a finite supply. The total number of mined bitcoin is at roughly 18.6 million, so it’s nearing its maximum threshold.;0;e

Nearly three years after it went on a hair-bending rise and hit a peak of $19,783, the price of a single Bitcoin rose above that for the first time on Monday, according to the data and news provider CoinDesk.;1;e
Some public companies also dived into Bitcoin because of concerns about the value of the dollar. In August, MicroStrategy, a software company in Virginia, said it bought $250 million of Bitcoin to store some of the cash it had in the corporate treasury.;1;e
In October, Square said it was putting $50 million of its corporate cash into Bitcoin. In 2018, Square also began offering the digital currency on the Cash App, its phone app that people use to send money between friends and family.;1;e
In October, analysts at JPMorgan Chase wrote a widely circulated note about how using Bitcoin as an alternative to gold — especially by younger investors — was creating a significant market for the tokens.;1;e
Central banks from countries such as Singapore, Sweden and the Bahamas are also looking at creating national digital currencies, inspired partly by Bitcoin.;1;e
Ether, the world’s second-largest virtual currency by market value, is up about 350% since the start of the year.;1;e
But proponents of Ethereum 2.0 say that the planned upgrade could allow thousands more transactions to take place every second. Meanwhile, investors believe it could also lead to further adoption of ether as well as price appreciation.;1;e
A big theme in Ethereum right now is decentralized finance, or DeFi, which aims to replicate traditional financial products such as loans without middlemen like the banks. Some crypto evangelists say Ethereum’s ability to support apps mean it could become a structure for a decentralized, next-generation internet.;1;s
“In essence, the Ethereum ecosystem has made the decision to grow up a little more and become a little more secure so that people, institutions and developers can continue to build more apps and financial products on top of it,” Konstantin Richter, CEO of blockchain software firm Blockdaemon, told CNBC.;1;e
A key problem with the Ethereum blockchain today is scalability. In 2017, for example, the popularity of an Ethereum-based game called CryptoKitties caused the network to become heavily congested, significantly slowing trade.;0;e
Another big development the upgrade will introduce is something called “sharding.” This effectively splits the network into lots of parallel chains that can handle transactions to speed up the network.;1;e
Further down the road, crypto experts say Ethereum 2.0 should help the Ethereum network run at scale, processing lots more transactions at a faster pace and supporting apps with millions of users.;1;e
Retail investors aged between 25 and 40 are spending millions on trading in cryptocurrency in India every day, according to two of the top exchanges in the country.;1;e
According to O’Leary, the problem with cryptocurrency overall is that it’s “not backed by anything. It’s just backed by your faith.”;0;e
Mastercard has become the latest payment company to give cryptocurrencies its blessing. The financial services firm has begun preparations to support select cryptocurrencies later this year, Mastercard’s digital asset and blockchain VP Raj Dhamodharan said in a blog post.;1;e
So if bulls hold their stake believing demand and ultimately price will increase, bitcoin will become more valuable because there is less on the open market. But those cautious about bitcoin warn that it is a market bubble.;0;e
After seeing a surge in crypto transactions, Mastercard is gearing up to onboard select currencies that meet its criteria around security, reliability and compliance. That effectively means that many virtual currencies may not make the cut at the first hurdle. At the same time, the move will allow many more retailers to accept crypto as a form of payment.;1;e
Bank of New York Mellon, the nation’s oldest bank, said Thursday that it will begin financing bitcoin and other digital currencies.;1;e
It will eventually allow digital currencies to pass through the same financial network it currently uses for more traditional holdings like U.S. Treasury bonds and equities.;1;e
“BNY Mellon is proud to be the first global bank to announce plans to provide an integrated service for digital assets,” said Roman Regelman, head of digital at BNY Mellon.;1;e
Bitcoin, off to a robust start to 2021, was up 7.7% to around $48,250 at 8:30 a.m. in New York, according to Coin Metrics.;1;e
The primary metric that a stablecoin will be judged by is consumer protection, including privacy and strict oversight of consumer information — essentially “the same level of security people have come to expect in their credit cards,” Dhamodharan said.;1;s
The fast-paced growth of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is making top multinationals prioritize digital payments.;1;e
Amazon laid out its vision for a new feature to convert cash into digital currency for online payments. The e-commerce giant has already begun assembling a team to lead the initiative in Mexico.;1;e
Cryptocurrencies “challenge the ability of governments to levy taxes and to control capital flows more broadly,” according to a recent report from Bank of America Securities obtained by CoinDesk. Uncertainty over how the U.S. governments will act to limit these use cases presents an key risk for cryptocurrency investors.;0;e
In an “extreme case,” regulators could simply ban all institutions and intermediaries from transacting with cryptocurrencies. Or the government could increase customer information reporting and access requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges, which the report describes as a more plausible possibility.;0;e
Bitcoin's big week got bigger with an announcement from rapper Jay Z and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey that the pair are establishing a bitcoin development fund.;1;e
"Dorsey tweeted the news Friday, writing that they are taking applications for a ""blind irrevocable trust"" focused on Africa and India. He promises the fund will have ""zero direction"" from himself and Jay Z and that the partners are searching for three board members. Dorsey and Jay Z are investing 500 bitcoin into the project, currently worth roughly $23 million.";1;e
itcoin is already in Dorsey's portfolio. His other company, Square, bought 4,709 bitcoins in October 2020, equal to $50 million at the time. In 2018, the company expanded its mobile payment service Cash App to support bitcoin trading, even for users without a bank account. And in 2019 it launched Square Crypto, which awards grants to bitcoin developers and designers.;1;e
The most valuable car company on the stock market, Tesla (TSLA), announced on Monday that it is holding some of its cash in bitcoin rather than traditional currency and might soon accept the cryptocurrency as payment for its cars.;1;e
"That news followed the revelation that the automaker is holding $1.5 billion in bitcoin on its balance sheet as part of a move to ""invest a portion of [the company's] cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets."" Tesla lists $19 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as of December 31.";1;e

"The credit card company is bringing bitcoin to the checkout counter, announcing Wednesday that it will support ""select cryptocurrencies"" directly on its network at some point later this year.";1;e
Although Mastercard (MA) was short on specifics, the company said the process might work something like this: When a customer wants to buy an item with bitcoin, Mastercard's crypto partners will convert the digital currency into traditional currency and transmit the funds over Mastercard's network.;1;e
"This change ""will allow many more merchants to accept crypto"" as well as ""cut out inefficiencies, letting both consumers and merchants avoid having to convert back and forth between crypto and traditional [currency] to make purchases,"" Mastercard said.";1;e

On Thursday, the cryptocurrency rallied to a fresh high, surpassing the $48,000 level, according to data from CoinDesk.;1;e
“It’s the best-performing asset of the last decade for sure,” said Daniel Polotsky, CEO of CoinFlip, one of the largest bitcoin ATM companies in the U.S.;1;e
Still, bitcoin has been on an incredible trajectory that’s outpaced other investments. So far in 2021 alone, the cryptocurrency has surged more than 63%, after quadrupling in value in 2020.;1;e
Most recently, the price of bitcoin has been driven by high-profile support. On Thursday, Bank of New York Mellon said it would provide custody services for digital assets, citing growing client demand.;1;e
Earlier in the week, Mastercard also said it would begin to offer support for cryptocurrencies on its network this year. And, on Monday, Tesla announced that it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin and that it would soon start to accept the currency as payment.;1;e
And, even though the cryptocurrency has also shown its trademark volatility in recent weeks, longtime bitcoin bulls see even more returns in the asset’s future.;1;e
Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital and a known cryptocurrency bull, in November said he sees bitcoin rising to $55,000 or $60,000 at the end of 2021 as it continues to replace gold. Tyler Winklevoss, another bitcoin bull and co-founder of crypto-exchange Gemini, said he could see the asset reaching $500,000 per coin one day.;1;e

U.S. banks were given some regulatory clarity thanks to last year’s interpretation letters from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In Germany, firms are queuing up to get their hands on special crypto custody licenses from the country’s regulator, BaFIN.;1;e
Deutsche, the world’s 21st largest bank, said it aims to “ensure the safety and accessibility of assets for clients by offering an institutional-grade hot/cold storage solution with insurance-grade protection.” No specific cryptocurrencies or tokens are mentioned.;1;e
The digital asset custody platform would be launched in stages. It would eventually provide clients with the ability to buy and sell digital assets via a partnership with prime brokers (which act sort of like concierges for hedge funds), issuers and vetted exchanges.;1;e
Deutsche Bank has joined the growing ranks of large financial institutions exploring cryptocurrency custody, with aspirations to offer high-touch services to hedge funds that invest in the asset class.;1;e
The Deutsche Bank Digital Asset Custody prototype aims to develop “a fully integrated custody platform for institutional clients and their digital assets providing seamless connectivity to the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem,” according to a little-noticed report by the World Economic Forum, host of the annual gathering of muckety-mucks in Davos, Switzerland.;1;e
In a passage buried on page 23 of the December 2020 report, Germany’s largest bank says it plans to create a trading and token issuance platform, bridging digital assets with traditional banking services, and managing the array of digital assets and fiat holdings in one easy-to-use platform.;1;e
Big banks are now announcing plans to enter crypto custody on an almost daily basis, with Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, joining the party earlier this week.;1;e
Cryptocurrency pioneer and early Bitcoin thought-leader Diana Biggs has joined Swiss-based startup Valour, which lets investors easily buy digital assets through their bank or broker.;1;e
Biggs explored the potential for blockchain technology to help solve humanitarian challenges through her venture, Proof of Purpose, in 2017, and her TEDx speech on Blockchain Technology that year is considered by many in the blockchain space to be one of the best in the genre.;1;e
Valour, a Zug, Switzerland-based issuer of investment products, brought in Biggs, the former Private Banking Global Head of Innovation for HSBC, as CEO after recently launching Bitcoin Zero, a fee-free, digital asset ETP product that trades on the NGM stock exchange.;1;e
Biggs, who has been in the Bitcoin space since 2013, told TechCrunch: “I have never seen this much attention to Bitcoin and other crypto-assets… The time for decentralized technologies has arrived, and their potential is increasingly realized by institutional investors.”;1;e
Johan Wattenström, the founder of Valour, said: “Diana is the perfect candidate to lead the company through this next phase of growth and expansion. With a wealth of experience in traditional finance, as well as fintech, and her vision for bringing digital assets into the mainstream, we feel very lucky to have her on board.” Wattenström created and listed the digital asset ETP on Nasdaq Nordic in 2015.;1;e
The executive director of the Blockchain Association, a body that represents the cryptocurrency industry, is Kristin Smith. Smith has commented that Biden appears more willing to accept the future involves Bitcoin and has shown signs of interest by installing Gary Gensler as one of his team members overseeing plans for Wall Street.;1;e
Gensler is also knowledgeable about the laws and regulations surrounding cryptocurrency, an area that is a significant problem facing the industry as traditional bankers and lawmakers are well-versed in the area.;1;e
"""He is very familiar with crypto and blockchain and hopefully can put the right team of regulators together that will be more willing to work together to advance policies,” Smith said of Gensler’s appointment.";1;e
One of the main problems facing the cryptocurrency market is that of regulation. Along with a widespread lack of knowledge of the subject among the traditional banking industry, this leads to a lack of stability in Bitcoin and other such currencies.;0;e
It deduced that any new regulations would harm the price of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.;0;e
The findings included the discovery that anti-money laundering regulations lead to a reduction in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as did the introduction of revised exchange regulations.;0;e
Conversely, where regulations were lessened, the opposite occurred. The cryptocurrencies rose in value.;1;e
Why is this important in the world of Bitcoin? Because freedom is an intrinsic element of cryptocurrencies and their usage, and because the industry is still young and growing, there are likely to be, as the article states, many more regulations covering cryptocurrencies and their usage in the future.;0;e
The weekend move pushed the world’s No. 1 digital asset to a fresh record mark of $49,716.44, according to CoinDesk, adding to a steady grind toward all-time highs as greater attention and more institutional investments in cryptos has provided a felicitous near-term backdrop for the virtual market.;1;e
Although, there is no specific news helping to extend gains for bitcoins, the rally comes as the asset appears to be gathering steam and increased attention among the traditional investment community.;1;e
That report comes after The Wall Street Journal earlier last week said that Bank of New York Mellon, BK would hold, transfer and issue bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on behalf of its clients.;1;e
“Digital assets are becoming part of the mainstream,” Roman Regelman, chief executive of BNY Mellon’s asset-servicing and digital businesses, was quoted as telling WSJ.;1;e
Several high-profile Wall Street investors, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones, also have embraced bitcoin. Famed investor Bill Miller, founder of Miller Value Partners, in a letter to clients recently reaffirmed his bullish outlook on bitcoin.;1;e
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) has suggested a ban on private cryptocurrencies in India, like Bitcoin, in India.;0;e
If the Centre goes by the recommendation of the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) then private cryptocurrencies will be banned in the country which will understandably cause a loss to the existing crypto investors of the country.;0;e
Speculation is also rife that the proposed cryptocurrency bill may allow holders of such currencies to exit the asset class before its anticipated ban but may put a heavy penalty on its conversion to a legal asset.;0;e
Companies are also making acquisitions in the cryptocurrency space. PayPal on Monday said it will buy cryptocurrency security firm Curv.;1;e
In a recent development in the cryptocurrency industry, Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX announced that his company Tesla invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin and intends to start accepting the currency as payment.;1;e
Post the announcement, the Bitcoin price soared to an all-time high of $48,034 (15% jump). At the time of writing this article, Bitcoin stands at $46,943.;1;e
As a result of the announcement, many analysts have highlighted the extreme volatility of bitcoin, emphasising the fact that investors could be wiped out if the digital currency plunges in the future.;0;e
On the other hand, Musk has also made a series of tweets on the alternative cryptocurrency Dogecoin, leading to a rise in the cryptocurrency’s value.;1;e
Numerous companies and startups in the UK are focusing on cryptocurrencies and Blockchains as this is the next big transformation in the fintech industry.;1;e
Mastercard has announced it will add cryptocurrency to its network. In a blog post on Wednesday, the international payments major indicated that it will give preference to 'stable coins' or cryptocurrencies that are linked to fiat currencies like the dollar.;1;e
The company has already teamed up with cryptocurrency players such as Wirex and Bitpay to launch cryptocurrency cards in the past, but those players were converting cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies at their end, the post added.;1;e
"""Our change to supporting digital assets directly will allow many more merchants to accept crypto — an ability that’s currently limited by proprietary methods unique to each digital asset,"" the blog post said.";1;e
A $150 billion Morgan Stanley investing arm known for its prowess in picking growth stocks is considering adding Bitcoin to its list of possible bets.;1;e
The government's draft bill on cryptocurrencies is likely to bar Indian companies and individuals from using digital currencies if cleared by parliament.;0;e
People, traders, exchanges, and other financial systems' participants will not be permitted to deal in cryptocurrencies, with penalties proposed in the draft law for any violation by corporates as well as individuals, NDTV reported.;0;e
The decision was taken after an inter-ministerial panel, including representatives from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), felt that private cryptocurrencies will pose a risk to the financial stability of the country.;0;e
The bill, which proposes a blanket ban on all private cryptocurrencies, will also lay the basis for an official digital currency with ties to the RBI, which can regulate it, the report added.;0;e
Both the Centre and the central bank have been cautioning against digital currencies and have advised all banks and financial institutions not to deal in them.;0;e
The rise in digital asset prices is driving crypto-related stocks to huge gains.;1;e
MicroStrategy, a company that provides business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services, was up as much as 16.77% on Monday. The firm said recently that it made large Bitcoin acquisitions amid a pullback in prices.;1;e
Cryptocurrency investors are responding to more institutional interest in Bitcoin and other digital assets.;1;e
The $2.7 billion, top 2% performing Miller Opportunity Trust, run by famed fund manager Bill Miller, said it might indirectly invest in Bitcoin through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), per Bloomberg.;1;e
California Public Employees' Retirement System also entered the crypto fray, buying 113,034 shares in the bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain at the end of 2020, according to regulatory filings.;1;e
And even Apple may be in the market for Bitcoin going forward, according to RBC Capital analyst Mitch Steves.;1;e
Miami Mayor Francis Suarez praised the city's governing commission for passing a resolution Thursday that will study the feasibility of paying employees in bitcoin, as well as allowing residents to pay fees and taxes in bitcoin;1;e
The City Commission voted 4-1 to pass the resolution, which would also encourage the Florida state legislature to pass laws to allow Miami to invest some of its treasury in bitcoin.;1;e
Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptocurrency, hit an all-time high of $48,912 this week, but it is still prone to wild price swings.;1;e
Despite those swings, Miami's adoption of bitcoin is the latest signal that it is going mainstream.;1;s
"Andrew Yang, who is running for Mayor of New York City, said Thursday that if elected, he would ""invest in making the city a hub for [bitcoin] and other cryptocurrencies.""";1;s

"""I do at this point think bitcoin is a good thing, and I am a supporter of bitcoin,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Jan. 31 on Clubhouse. ""I think bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people.""";1;e
On Friday afternoon, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a circular asking commercial banks and other financial institutions to close accounts transacting in, or operating on, cryptocurrency exchanges.;0;e
The CBN also asked banks to identify “persons and or entities transacting in or operating cryptocurrency exchanges within their systems and ensure that such accounts are closed immediately.”;0;e
The fact that digital currencies are protected from inflation, capital controls, or exchange rate depreciation has seen many Nigerians turn to them for financial trades such as cross-border remittances and e-commerce. Startups have sprung up to facilitate these trades.;1;e
Bitcoin was also used to fund activists during last year’s widespread protests against police brutality in the country, after the government and Central Bank allegedly blocked donations coming through local payment platforms.;1;s
However, moves to have it regulated have been protracted. Some African countries like Algeria, Morocco, and Libya have laws prohibiting cryptocurrency outright.;0;e
Some fintech platforms facilitating crypto-related transactions have complied so far with the CBN’s approach. Binance, through its owner Changpeng Zhao, made an announcement on Twitter asking users to “withdraw your NGN as early as possible to avoid potential channel issues.”;0;e
Former vice-president Atiku Abubakar was one of the critics of the policy over the weekend, saying he believes it would stifle an already unhealthy economy. “This is definitely the wrong time to introduce policies that will restrict the inflow of capital into Nigeria, and I urge that the policy to prohibit the dealing and transaction of cryptocurrencies be revisited,” Abubakar wrote on Twitter, calling for regulation instead.;1;e
"
Bitcoin surges to record $28,500, quadrupling in value this year";1;e
As the US dollar has declined, bitcoin has become a more attractive investment amid concerns that huge government stimulus packages prompted by the coronavirus pandemic will fuel inflation.;1;e
Bitcoin has also been boosted by expectations that it will become a more mainstream payment method. PayPal has launched a crypto trading service on its platform and has reportedly bought nearly 70% of all new bitcoin in circulation.;1;e
However, concerns remain about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, and there are regulatory issues.

Mobile cryptocurrency wallet BRD announced today that it now has more than six million users worldwide, thanks to strong growth in India and Latin America. With this momentum, the company expects to reach 10 million users by early 2021.;1;e
People have had a lot more time over the last six months to look at their investments and as a result of that, we found that for cryptocurrency in general, but especially for BRD’s business, we’ve been growing dramatically.;1;e
He added that BRD, which has raised $55 million in funding from investors like SBI Crypto Investment and East Ventures, has two main groups of users. The first are millennials who have discretionary income that they invest using apps like Robinhood instead of traditional brokerages. The second group are people who have been more financially impacted by the pandemic and are turning to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to cope with currency fluctuations in their countries or as a more cost-effective alternative to international wire transfers to send money to family members.;1;e
While Bitcoin and Ethereum are still the most popular purchases through BRD, in countries with volatile currency fluctuations, like Venezuela, Argentina and India, interest in stablecoins, which are pegged to the U.S. dollar, is growing. The company is also seeing more adoption in Eastern European countries.;1;e
BRD is a non-custodial wallet and cryptocurrencies are stored on users’ devices, which makes it more accessible to users in countries who need to undergo lengthy registration processes to use custodial wallets. The app also allows people to use Apple Pay or their bank cards to buy cryptocurrency. This ease of use is one of the reasons for its growth;1;e

Criminal case opened against Mirror Trading International;0;p
The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has opened a criminal case against Mirror Trading International, claiming that the company and its senior management are conducting an illegal operation, are misleading customers and have broken several laws.;0;p
The FSCA also said that Mirror Trading International (MTI) is not licensed to offer financial services and has not applied for such a license.;0;p
According to the FSCA, when MTI began trading in April 2019, it transferred members' bitcoin, which had been deposited in their wallets, to a cryptocurrency platform called FXChoice.;0;s
The FSCA reported that Steynberg stated that MTI experienced substantial losses of up to 80% during this period and, as a result, MTI requested its members to unlink their respective accounts from the multi-account manager account and move their bitcoins to a pooled account.;0;e
During October 2020, after the FSCA informed MTI that it was conducting an illegal unregistered financial services business, MTI claimed that it changed its business activities to trade in cryptocurrency-based derivative instruments (Bitcoin), such that it was no longer within the jurisdiction of the FSCA, and that it no longer required a [financial services provider] license;0;e
FXChoice confirmed that MTI placed 1846.72 bitcoins from January 29, 2020 to June 3, 2020 and made a loss of 566.68 bitcoins, a capital loss of approximately 30%.;0;e
The total amount of crypto assets frozen at FXChoice is a negligible amount, considering the total assets MTI claimed to have invested on behalf of its customers;0;e
FSCA reported that Steynberg and MTI's head of communications, Cheri Marks, stated that MTI's trading activities were moved from FXChoice to Trade300.;0;e
According to Steynberg, Trade300 is yet another online trading platform;1;e
MTI provided evidence of the transfer in the form of Bitcoin wallets and stated that it transferred 16,444 bitcoins from FXChoice to Trade300 in four installments on July 21, 2020, July 22, 2020 and July 24, 2020.;0;e
the FSCA said it found that no Bitcoin withdrawals by MTI from FXChoice occurred in July 2020.;0;e
MTI's last bitcoin withdrawal of bitcoin from FXChoice was in August 2019.;0;e
FXChoice also confirmed to the FSCA that none of the eight remittance wallets provided as evidence by MTI are related to FXChoice, and that FXChoice did not receive deposits or send any payments to any of these eight bitcoin wallets.;0;e
The company Mirror Trading International has been working with us and in the Crypto Hispanos portfolio for more than a year. But these last days the company is delaying with the withdrawals requested by the users, taking up to a week.;0;e
Bitcoin takes off and positions itself above 20K$.;1;e
Bitcoin surpasses the $20,000 mark for the first time and stands at an all-time high of $20,595.;1;e
Bitcoin has grown by more than 170% this year, driven by demand from large investors, inflation-resistant qualities and expectations that it will become an established payment method.;1;e
Investors, such as family funds, which manage the investments of wealthy individuals, have sought cryptocurrency as a hedge against any future inflation stemming from central bank stimulus measures, according to analysts.;1;e
The supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million. Proponents say its scarcity provides innate value and protects it from central bank or government policies that stoke inflation.;1;e
BBVA will allow its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin;1;e
Bitcoin has been receiving significant support from the financial industry in recent times, and the cryptocurrency has now found another ally: BBVA bank will launch a bitcoin trading and custody service in January 2021.;1;e
It will do so through its Swiss subsidiary and will thus become a reference when it comes to operating with these cryptocurrencies among members of traditional banking, who until now seemed to have been more reluctant to support this type of service.;1;e
"BBVA's backing comes after five years of ""exploring blockchain technology,"" say its officials, who now see an appropriate time to ""explore its first offering geared toward digital asset management.""";1;e
The service comes to, according to BBVA, respond to the growing demand from highly knowledgeable investors who were already operating with these digital currencies, and will allow customers to combine traditional financial assets with bitcoins in their investment portfolios.;1;e
"This bitcoin trading and custody service will also have ""all the guarantees of any other financial service"", and although initially it will only operate with bitcoins ""because it is the most widely accepted cryptocurrency"", the plan is to extend this support to other currencies.";1;e
"BBVA will not offer investment advice, adds the official announcement, which also argues that the start of operations in Switzerland. This choice is due to the fact that ""the Swiss country has a very advanced ecosystem in terms of regulation and adoption of digital assets"".";1;e

As companies and investors increasingly say they are focused on climate and sustainability, the cryptocurrency’s huge carbon footprint could become a red flag.;0;s
“Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind, and so it’s not a great climate thing.”Bill Gates;0;s
To put this into perspective, one Bitcoin transaction is the “equivalent to the carbon footprint of 735,121 Visa transactions or 55,280 hours of watching YouTube,” according to Digiconomist;0;s
“As the resource intensity of running Bitcoin has increased over recent years, it has become a serious concern for its potential impact on health and climate,” Alex de Vries, a data scientist who put the index together, wrote in the journal Energy Research & Social Science.;0;s

Government’s calibrated approach towards cryptocurrency will provide opportunities to companies for large scale innovation and job creation in the cryptocurrency industry.;1;e
India's leading cryptocurrency players, represented by IAMAI (Internet and Mobile Association of India) on Wednesday appealed to the government of India not to ban cryptocurrency, while saying that a robust mechanism should be established to regulate the ecosystem.;1;p
Bitcoin’s value briefly surpassed $1 trillion on Tuesday as the price of the cryptocurrency jumped.;1;e
The digital coin’s price rose on Tuesday and its market capitalization went above $1 trillion in mid-morning trade Singapore time.;1;e
It is only the second time that bitcoin’s value has surpassed a $1 trillion after hitting that milestone for the first time on Feb. 19.;1;e
Bitcoin’s rally has been attributed to several factors including participation from larger institutional investors and some notable purchases from corporations. Tesla, Square and Microstrategy are among the companies that have purchased bitcoin.;1;e
Christine Lagarde has insisted that a digital euro would be a complement to cash rather than a substitute for it—and may not spell doom for the Facebook-founded Libra stablecoin project.;1;e
This shift in attitudes doesn’t mean that the likes of Facebook’s Libra will be given carte blanche to operate with complete freedom—indeed, quite the opposite.;0;e
Facebook Inc’s ambitious efforts to establish a global digital currency called Libra suffered severe setbacks on Friday, as major payment companies including Mastercard and Visa Inc quit the group behind the project.;0;e
“Visa has decided not to join the Libra Association at this time,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association’s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.”;0;e
Facebook’s planned cryptocurrency Libra will be linked to individual national currencies and overseen by global watchdogs in a scaled-back revamp it hopes will win regulatory approval.;1;p
Some countries, including France and Germany, had said they would seek to block Libra’s launch, while other global bodies scrambled to set out rules for stablecoins.;0;p
Facebook has framed the digital coin as an alternative to traditional financial services for the billions of people worldwide who lack access to banking. But lawmakers say Libra would threaten government-backed currencies and consumer privacy, while giving Facebook reign over an unprecedented global financial system.;0;s
"Fears around widespread adoption of Libra have been shared by leaders around the globe. In a speech before the French Senate on Thursday, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he was resolutely against Libra becoming a “sovereign currency"" that could compete with state currencies.";0;p
concerns persist that Libra’s power would be more or less unchecked. In tweets Thursday, President Trump attacked cryptocurrencies and said Libra would have to be subject to banking regulations.;0;e
Libra plans to launch a series of different digital coins, each backed by a different government currency one for one. It will also build a Libra coin that is a “digital composite” of some of those coins, which will be available for cross-border transactions and in countries with no digital currency.;0;e
Amid growing bipartisan resistance to its proposed digital coin, Facebook says that it won't move forward with its Libra cryptocurrency without full government approval and regulatory oversight.;0;p
With close to 2.5 billion users worldwide, it was clear that Facebook's ambition was to create globally dominant currency, expanding financial services and the associated benefits to corners of the world where they don't currently exist.;0;p
Since Facebook announced plans for libra last year, most governments on the planet (and their central banks) have gone into overdrive to thwart the project.;0;e
Facebook has created a management tool it has named Calibra, which will offer digital wallets to save, send and spend Libras.;1;e
Calibra will only share user data with parent company Facebook and third parties when it has customer consent, or in other “limited cases”- such as when law enforcement requests information – according to a statement.;1;e
One of the co-founders of Facebook’s libra digital currency and Novi payments wallet has left the company before the release of either technology.;0;e
The recent survey by financial services company Jefferies indicates that US users will barely use Facebook's upcoming stablecoin, Libra, due to a lack of trust.;0;S
The path of national organizations - and amalgamated to traditional systems - towards economic modernization has not been easy. This is evidenced by the multiple regulatory obstacles to Facebook's Libra project, which surprised an inexperienced system with a lack of digital infrastructure.;0;P
Libra claimed to have received interest from 1,500 organizations to join the project, but not all met the eligibility requirements. The announcement came after the abandonment of the seventh company.;0;E
From being a rival of bitcoin to becoming an alternative to Paypal linked to the already established currencies. A change to suit the wishes of regulatory bodies, both European and American.;1;P
To appreciate basic insights on how a cryptocurrency can jeopardize economic stability, compare the Libra plan to Bitcoin’s growth as an important cryptocurrency in the past decade. The Libra may become too powerful and economically unpredictable if issued.;0;E
Although Facebook walked back plans for Libra in April 2020 in response to stakeholder pressure, opting instead for Libra to act more like a digital payment than a global monetary alternative, concerns remain about the project’s scope.;0;E
Being a global currency was Libra's big bet, which differentiated it from other currencies and also made it promising compared to other cryptocurrencies due to its own programming language or opaque reserve. This has been fading little by little over the months and as the concerns of governments and economic organizations have arisen.;0;E
The cryptocurrency bitcoin and Libra, backed by Facebook, could play a role in a world where central banks globally begin to issue their own digital currencies, a former senior central banker told CNBC's “Beyond the Valley” podcast.;1;P
Libra, the stablecoin project that Facebook is trying to boost with the collaboration of other large companies, has signs of being titanic and could pose risks to market stability, according to the European Central Bank.;0;P
Stable-rate cryptocurrencies such as pound, known as stablecoins, aim to establish themselves as an alternative to traditional money and extend access to the financial system. In order to become a global payment system, these types of currencies put aside the volatility of other virtual currencies such as bitcoin.;1;E
Although it relies on currencies, the ECB is afraid of the effects of a loss of end-user confidence in the stablecoin.;0;P
The fear of the Libra, the virtual currency that Facebook wants to introduce, and the impact of the Covid-19 have served as catalysts to boost cryptoeurs. The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced this Friday that it is accelerating work on the possible introduction of a digital euro, an electronic form of money that would complement bills and coins.;0;e
"The report identifies a number of scenarios that would require the issuance of a digital euro. Among them, it highlights ""the creation of private means of payment on a global scale that could generate regulatory problems and represent risks for financial stability and consumer protection"". In other words, the ECB sees the digital euro as its weapon to counteract the influence of Libra.";0;e
The great powers of the EU (Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Holland) have signed this Friday a joint declaration in which they demand the strictest possible regulation of the crypto-currencies that will allow them to prohibit those that do not conform to European requirements.;0;p
The initiative is a declaration of war on the project of the American giant Facebook to create its own virtual currency called Libra, with the aim of achieving cheaper and faster transfers. A project that is currently stopped precisely because of the doubts it generates in regulators around the world.;0;p
"""We put forward a very simple principle: the European Central Bank is the only one that should be allowed to issue currency. And this principle cannot be threatened or weakened by any kind of project, including Libra,"" insisted Le Maire.";0;e
Issuers of crypto assets backed by significant assets (so-called 'stable crypto currencies' such as Facebook's Pound) would be subject to more stringent requirements (e.g. in terms of capital, investor rights and supervision).;0;p
Libra published an updated whitepaper containing four major changes, one of which was the new token mechanism. Instead of a stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies, the project now plans to run a system of a stablecoin backed by a multitude of fiat currencies. Therefore, at launch, there could be tokens such as LibraUSD, LibraGBP and LibraEUR among others.;1;e
Nearly two billion people worldwide use Facebook. The expansion of the shopping cart to include central bank currencies makes it possible for anyone to use Calibra as a more traditional payment system. Any user who has Messenger or WhatsApp installed on their mobile device could send funds worldwide at the touch of a button.;1;s
Tagomi, a New York-based cryptomoney brokerage firm, will join the Libra Association, the governing body of the Facebook-led stablecoin. Tagomi will become the 22nd member of the Libra Association. Members of the association are expected to contribute at least $10 million to the Libra Reserve, which holds the assets that support cryptomonics.;1;e
A silver lining to Libra's rocky start may be the response of central banks as they learn to accept digital currencies as the new reality. Since the project was announced, several countries have explored the possibility of minting a digital currency, including Japan, China and England.;1;p
Seven central banks have joined forces with a clear objective: to create a digital currency that raises the reference alternative and thus serves to try to overcome the efforts of the China project and also proposals such as that of Facebook with Libra.;0;p
Along with the entities mentioned are the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Swiss National Bank, but not the People's Bank of China. This country already has a pilot project underway with its official digital cryptocurrency (DC / EP), and with it they want to achieve that the scope of the yuan is the same as that of the dollar.;0;p
"The financial leaders of the seven largest economies in the world (G7) will announce this Tuesday that they oppose the launch of the ""stablecoin"" Libra, launched by Facebook until it is duly regulated, according to their draft declaration.";0;p
The G7 still holds that no global stablecoin project should begin operating until it adequately addresses relevant supervisory, regulatory and legal requirements through proper design and adhering to applicable standards.;0;p
The G-20 Financial Stability Board set 10 recommendations in April for a common, international approach to regulating stablecoins, after social media giant Facebook proposed the launch of Libra.;0;p
In the past three years, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected several applications for a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This frustrates the hopes of many investors who believed that the price of Bitcoin would rise further if an EFT was approved.;0;e
The most recent Bloomberg newsletter on cryptocurrencies predicts that a Bitcoin ETF could see the light of day if the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Joe Biden, is elected as the next president of the United States. The author believes that a change in command can bring regulatory clarity to drive more investment to the world of digital assets.;1;p
In China there are different cryptocurrencies that work with a blockchain system operated by the government, one of them is the iShenzhen. To encourage its use, 10 million yuan is being raffled off and any interested citizen will be able to participate.;1;s
The iShenzhen is a digital currency, not traditional, because it is a system controlled by the government, to avoid fluctuation, and supported by the People's Bank of China, an official financial institution. According to the American portal, other cities have also presented and tested their cryptocurrencies such as Xiongan, Suzhou and Chengdu.;1;p
In relation to the general requirements that the project poses for companies linked to cryptocurrencies, Idoya Arteagabeitia explains that it is a drastic change, because it goes from having no regulation at all to having to comply with many regulations.;0;p
Con estos comentarios Gómez se remite a una declaración suscrita por España, Francia, Italia, Alemania y Países Bajos, en la cual apoyan el plan de regulación de la Comisión Europea y solicitan reglas fuertes para las stablecoins.;0;p
On this, the Spanish lawyer Javier Maestre wrote an article pointing out that so many bureaucratic, financial and technical requirements will discourage innovation and impose strong entry barriers to markets related to crypto assets.;0;p
"""I think the problem that really worries regulators is Libra (Facebook's cryptocurrency project),"" concludes Gómez Toribio. He affirms that behind all this is the fear of the European authorities that a company with billions of users could place a financial product on the European market, in this case a global stablecoin.";0;p
A Chilean entity dedicated to the education and promotion of the use of cryptocurrencies has issued an alert in the country against 20 companies that promote fraud through the use of cryptocurrencies.;0;s
"During his time as director of the UK Financial Conduct Authority, Bailey told Members of Parliament at a Treasury Select Committee hearing that investors should ""be prepared to lose all [their] money"", as the Crypto asset has no intrinsic value.";0;s
The restructuring could help Libra with regulation. The original plan led some to characterize Libra as a security, a designation that brings much greater regulatory oversight. Some central banks also worried that a popular coin backed by a basket of currencies would undermine their ability to manage fluctuations of their home currency, a concern the Libra Association acknowledged in its white paper.;1;p
Facebook Inc. and its partners said their Libra cryptocurrency project will now support multiple versions of the digital coins, the majority of which will be backed by individual fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, as part of changes made to appease skeptical regulators worldwide.;1;e
In building the Libra system, the association has incorporated feedback from regulators. Amid regulatory scrutiny, some of Libra supporters have left the project, including Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Vodafone, and Shopify. Some supporters now also back a competing project, Celo. This week, the G20 discussed setting rules for the regulation of stablecoins like Libra.;0;e
The Libra Association, a member organization of Facebook's Libra initiative, has appointed James Emmett, former chief executive of investment bank HSBC Europe, as the CEO and managing director of Libra Networks, according to an announcement published today. He will take up his new role on October 1.;1;e
While the idea is still being debated, central banks would likely issue digital versions of fiat currencies. The People’s Bank of China is already doing pilots while other central banks are considering whether to issue their own.;1;p
Libra takes a more centralized approach. It is a project that was proposed by a Facebook-led consortium of companies last year. But Libra drew heavy criticism from regulators, particularly because of its ties to Facebook and its murky track record of data privacy.;0;s
The idea is for Libra to be a so-called “stable coin” which would be backed by a basket of global currencies. That would keep its value stable in contrast with the volatility that has been seen in bitcoin. Libra has scaled down some of its ambitions. Earlier this year, the Libra Association applied to obtain approval from regulators to issue a digital currency backed by one currency. That would mean the consortium’s digital coin may be equivalent to a euro or a U.S. dollar;1;e
The project has brought in a number of high-level hires since announcing a revamp and formally applying for a Swiss payments license in April, many of them specialised in financial compliance and with ties to U.S. government and authorities.;1;p
Central banks and regulators had feared its original plan for a single coin backed by various currencies and government debt, unveiled in June 2019, could erode national control over money if adopted widely by Facebook’s billions of users.;0;p
On the heels of the U.S. Mint’s decision to phase out the production of pennies next year, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a California-based venture capital firm, said money will be digital by 2030. Kathryn Haun predicted that cash is on its way out.;1;e
Meanwhile, digital assets continue to gain legitimacy in the financial services world. In addition, government entities have become interested in “stablecoin” technology.;1;p
With Libra, Facebook was hoping to create a simple, cheap way for people to move money around within Facebook, but various regulatory concerns have slowed the project's development, which has then forced the company to look at other alternatives in order to facilitate funds transfer, and ultimately, eCommerce exchange within its apps.;0;p
With Libra still in development, Facebook Pay has become the key focus for this push, and as such, making it easier to link your Facebook Pay account to every other Facebook app is a key element in facilitating on-platform purchases, funds exchange, remittance;1;e
Facebook renamed its Calibra digital wallet ‘Novi’, presumably to emphasise that its ambitions extend beyond simply serving as a personal storage mechanism for Libra value.;1;e
Morgan Beller, who is a co-creator of the proposed Libra digital currency, along with Facebook vice presidents David Marcus and Kevin Weil, has left the company to become a general partner with the venture firm NFX .;0;p
The US government shouldn't even be entertaining the idea that Facebook be allowed to create its own currency and financial-services arm — Libra and Calibra, respectively. The company has done nothing but demonstrate that it cannot be trusted with global financial transactions.;0;p
None of that matters — none of Marcus' promises or clarifications or assurances mean anything. Facebook's word is no good. Opposition to Libra has nothing to do with innovation, this is about working with people you can trust.;0;p
"Libra appears designed to overcome a common criticism of existing cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum – that they don’t satisfy three essential characteristics of money: a medium of exchange; a store of value and a unit of account";1;e
Facebook boasts over half the world population as active monthly users: 2.2 billion on Facebook, 0.8 billion on Instagram and 0.7 billion on WhatsApp. Combined with the fact that 1.7 billion adults worldwide have no bank accounts, a project like this is the perfect petri dish in which to create a truly global currency.;1;e
"A statement from Dante Disparte, Head of Policy and Communications for the Libra Association, said ""The Libra Association has not altered its goal of building a regulatory compliant global payment network, and the basic design principles that support that goal have not been changed.""";1;e
Some people would not be comfortable using a financial product built by Facebook, Weil said. This even though Facebook will not share the data collected by Calibra with the social network part of the business, Weil promised.;0;s
According to the report, Facebook no longer intends to make the Libra token — the actual blockchain-based cryptocurrency it’s in the process of developing in partnership with the nonprofit Libra Association — the centerpiece of its digital payments strategy. Instead, Facebook’s Libra project will reportedly transition to supporting both existing government-backed currencies, like the US dollar and the euro, and the Libra token when it is eventually completed and ready to launch.;1;e
Despite those measures, the Libra project was met with swift and vocal backlash from across the political spectrum. Regulators were concerned about Facebook’s potential outsize influence on the project, due to the company having conceived of the idea and having a financial interest in its success, and the unforeseen consequences of allowing for-profit companies to begin issuing currencies and injecting themselves into global economics and geopolitics.;0;p
Facebook is launching a subsidiary company also called Calibra that handles its crypto dealings and protects users’ privacy by never mingling your Libra payments with your Facebook data so it can’t be used for ad targeting. Your real identity won’t be tied to your publicly visible transactions.;1;s
Facebook and its partners rolled out a less ambitious design for Libra after the effort encountered numerous hurdles and heavy regulatory scrutiny.;0;p
Members of the Libra Association, a Swiss-based group that Facebook created to oversee the project, said the shifts were a response to a global outpouring of opposition to the cryptocurrency.;0;p
This was never going to fly. Facebook is a real, touchable company. You can abuse people’s private information — but governments take the money very seriously;0;p
Facebook isn't getting any love for Libra. The social network and its planned cryptocurrency have endured a withering month as partners bolt from the project, details start to shift and legislators amp up their criticism of the ambitious plans. The concerns reached a crescendo on Wednesday, when a key US committee laid into CEO Mark Zuckerberg, using Libra as evidence of what they saw as the company's cavalier attitude toward everything from data breaches to misleading political ads.;0;e
I have come to the conclusion that it would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project.;0;e
Its partners in the Libra Association include Lyft, Spotify, Shopify, but several other high-profile members such as Visa left after the idea was criticised by authorities.;0;e
according to Facebook’s David Marcus, the executive who is leading its blockchain initiative, previously testified to the United States Congress that Libra’s intent is to become more of a traditional currency rather than cryptocurrency. I think that is where the downslope started!;0;e
The federal agency that oversees banks issued a letter on Monday that gives financial institutions a green light to hold reserves to support so-called stablecoins—digital currencies similar to Bitcoin that are backed on a one-to-one basis by real-world money.;1;e
Morgan Beller, a co-founder of Facebook Inc.’s Libra digital currency project, has left Novi, the company formerly known as Calibra that was set up by Facebook to commercialize the idea.;0;e
Facebook announced in April that it was abandoning its original plans for Libra and that it had decided to offer a range of currency-backed stablecoins.;0;e
The EU will set up a new college of supervisors, including national and European authorities, to oversee “significant” digital currencies including Facebook’s Libra, according to the European Commission’s cryptocurrency draft proposal seen by EURACTIV.;1;e
It's hard to predict the timeline but the People's Bank of China is under a lot of pressure to accelerate the development because they do not want to be in a world where Libra (Facebook's digital currency) becomes the global currency, which they think is worse than the current global financial system controlled by the US;0;e
The association announced Sterling Daines as the chief compliance officer of the outfit, said a statement provided to Cointelegraph staff. Daines will leave his post at Credit Suisse at some point in 2020 to assume his role at the Libra Association.;1;e
I am pleased to join the Libra Association as it works to transform the digital payment space to empower billions of people;1;e
A critical element of achieving this mission is to ensure we are building a safe, compliant, and reliable platform for all users, which I look forward to significantly contributing to.;1;s
A number of the Libra Association's recent hires show the outfit's desire for regulatory compliance.;1;p
Libra, la moneda digital blockchain propuesta por Facebook, es una idea horrible cuyo momento nunca debería llegar porque facilita enormemente las actividades criminales y nefastas , incluido el terrorismo, el tráfico de drogas, la trata de personas, el lavado de dinero y la evasión fiscal.;0;e
Blockchain Capital, one of the largest venture capital firms in the blockchain industry, has joined the Libra Association, according to an official announcement Friday;1;e
The draft text also obliges the Libra Association and the issuers other significant e-money tokens, to redeem, at any moment and at par value, the monetary value of the e-money tokens if the holders decide, either in cash or by credit transfers. The rules also impose the prohibition of granting any interests to holders of these digital assets.;0;p
The Libra Association has appointed former U.S. Department of Homeland Security general counsel Steve Bunnell as the Geneva-based cryptocurrency membership organization’s latest chief legal officer.;1;s
“Sound European rules for private initiatives to create crypto currencies, such as the stablecoin Libra planned by Facebook, are of utmost importance. We must prevent potential suppliers such as the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg from using their market power to take over the functions of central banks”, said Stefan Berger MEP, EPP Group Shadow Rapporteur on a Report on crypto-assets, ahead of this week’s presentation of new legislative proposals on digital finance by the European Commission.;0;p
According to reports, Emmett will develop and operate the payment system associated with Libra, which goes by the name of the Calibra wallet. Emmett’s appointment marks the latest in a string of several high-profile hires for the company, which have occurred over the past five or six months. The company applied for a Swiss payments license in April, which has given it an opportunity to bring on several financial experts outside the U.S. to join its growing list of executives.;1;e
Two Finance ministers (current and former), several senior officials at the Finance ministry and the banking regulator have expressed the dangers of cryptocurrency-trading. Some called it a fraud, dabba-trading and pointed out bitcoins could be used in illegal activities such as hawala, human-trafficking, funding terrorism etc. The Reserve Bank asked banks not to honour cryptocurrency and related transactions on their networks. The RBI's notification was quashed by the Supreme Court in March this year. An inter-ministerial committee headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, in 2019, proposed banning cryptocurrencies except those backed by the government.;0;p
As Modern Consensus reported yesterday, ECB President Christine Lagarde recently suggested that its central bank digital currency—the digital euro— will leave room for privately issued stablecoins such as Facebook’s Libra.;1;s
The European Union will introduce new rules within four years to make cross-border payments quicker and cheaper through the use of blockchain and crypto assets like stablecoins, two EU documents showed.;1;p
Facebook's announcement last year of plans to design the Libra cryptocurrency and payments system raised immediate red flags for global finance officials who expressed a barrage of withering criticism about the security and reliability of a private network.;0;e
Plans by Facebook and other private companies to issue so-called stablecoins backed by government securities could disrupt the supply of collateral to financial markets, says a new working paper from the International Monetary Fund.;0;e
Many national governments and central banks have been turning their attention to centralized digital currencies. Another alternative that has been increasingly mentioned involves stablecoins backed by the U.S. dollar or the euro. Facebook’s Libra, with its scaled back plans to offer multiple options each backed by a local fiat currency, might be in a position to accelerate this process.;1;e
According to Brainard, the Covid-19 outbreak reinforces the need for immediate and reliable access to funds. “The introduction of Bitcoin and the subsequent emergence of stablecoins with potentially global reach, such as Facebook’s Libra, have raised fundamental questions about legal and regulatory safeguards, financial stability and the role of currency in society.” This idea has “intensified” the demand for CBDCs to “maintain the sovereign currency as the anchor of the nation’s payment systems. Brainard also didn’t forget to mention that China is rapidly progressing with its DCEP development.;1;s
As such, CBDC could be the next front in a technology-based cold war, which has included things like the Google tax, and in which regard it’s not at all surprising to find that Europe appears to be more outraged than anyone over Facebook’s libra plans.;0;p
Carrillo also warned against Big Tech entering into finance, in keeping with similar concerns from Maxine Waters (D-CA), Chairwoman of the full committee. “We are especially concerned by dominant tech platforms’ recent encroachment into payments, most notably the proposed Facebook Libra project,” said Carrillo.;0;p
The proposal on cryptoassets seeks to leverage the potential of this Fintech innovation while mitigating potential risk and preserving financial stability. European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis noted that there are special rules for stablecoins, like Facebook’s Libra, including more stringent requirements:;0;p
