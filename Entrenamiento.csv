Some called it a fraud, dabba-trading and pointed out bitcoins could be used in illegal activities such as hawala, human-trafficking, funding terrorism etc. The Reserve Bank asked banks not to honour cryptocurrency and related transactions on their networks. The RBI's notification was quashed by the Supreme Court in March this year.
